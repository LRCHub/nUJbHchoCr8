Lucy the world has changed,
l'm sorry we're left behind
You said the years were running out,
so you changed your mind
O Lucy the world has changed. We're all fucked up
Please don't judge me now, there'll be time for that

You saved my life with a butterfly kiss
I had so many troubles that nothing could fix
Even the guy I was in Twenty Ten
is a stranger to me now

I know where we're going now,
the world of never again
Every memory I have is a danger to me now
O Lucy the world has changed,
I'm sorry you're left behind
But it's not such a bad thing if people were kind

You saved my life with a butterfly kiss
I had so many troubles that nothing could fix
Instead of singing through the Summer
I shoulda worked instead

I went singing through the Summer, singing
I went singing through the Summer, singing
Singing through the Summer, I went singing
I went singing through the Summer
Jake, Jake, Jake-this is Chinatown...

You saved my life with a butterfly kiss,
so many troubles I just couldn't fix
I went singing through the Summer,
then the Winter set in
I went singing through the Summer,
then the Winter set in

When it's gone, it's gone... it's gone, it's gone

Even the guy I was in Twenty Ten
is a stranger to me now
Even the guy I was in Twenty Ten
is a stranger to me now

So many troubles... a stranger to me now

Every memory I have is a danger to me now
Every memory I have is a danger to me now
Every memory I have

I went singing through the Summer...
then the Winter set in
